# Azure Monitor Workbook - Resources Changes

This Azure Workbook uses the powerful `resourcechanges` table from Azure Resource Graph to display a history of changes in your environment. 

By querying this table, the workbook shows **what was modified, who made the change, and when it happened**.

**Example**:
![img](./img/Workbook_img.png)
